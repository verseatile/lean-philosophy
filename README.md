# Lean Philosophy

Lean UX is a philiosophy that places UX (user experience) at the core of creating applications, experiences, and various alternate forms of output. It is seen as the evolution of the product design process that focuses heavily on a few core things:
- process
- collaboration
- management
- what "works" over "features"
- market feedback

The core foundations of Lean UX are:
- design thinking
- true agile software development

    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan

### A refresh on understand agile

#### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

To solve top level problems, the entire team needs to be engaged. People should feel comfortable with sharing ideas often, and the pre-existing tools and processes should be a fallback plan. Collaboration artifacts from working together with a team come first.

#### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Focus on most viable solutions. How do you reach working software sooner without a large sacrifice in quality?

#### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Spending time collaborating with teammates and users helps everyone better understand the problem at hand. This leads to clear agreement when decisions are made, which results in faster iteration. This reduces the need for massive documents to record the process since everyone involved were present for decision making.

#### Responding to change over following a plan

One should assume that the initial design of a product will be wrong/bad. The true goal should be to find out what is wrong as soon as possible. Fail fast and get up stronger.

## Principles

### Cross-Functional Teams
In most cases, this team will be composed of:
- Design (UX & Visual/Product)
- Software Engineering
- QA
- Product Management
- Project Management

The core team should remain small and max out at no more than 10 active individuals.



## Changes Required for Success

- Rapid Prototyping
- Note-taking/outcome of stakeholder discussions
- Engage in process (Build, Measure, Learn)
    - Create hypothesis
    - Create accompanying solution or design
    - Collect feedback
    - Improve based on feedback, then repeat
